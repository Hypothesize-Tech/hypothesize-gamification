# Gamification Features

This application is designed to help startup founders on their journey using engaging gamification mechanics. Here's how gamification is integrated and what each feature means:

## XP & Levels

- **XP (Experience Points):** Earned by completing quests, generating documents, and engaging with the AI Sage. XP helps you level up as a founder.
- **Levels:** Your level increases as you gain more XP, visually tracking your progress and unlocking new achievements.

## Quests & Stages

- **Quests:** Structured tasks grouped into stages (e.g., Fundamentals, Kickoff, Go-to-Market, Growth). Each quest represents a key startup milestone or learning goal.
- **Stages:** Themed areas of your journey, each with its own set of quests and rewards.

## Achievements & Badges

- **Achievements:** Special milestones (e.g., completing onboarding, generating documents, consulting the AI Sage) that reward you with badges and bonus XP.
- **Badges:** Visual icons representing your accomplishments, displayed in your dashboard and profile.

## CEO Avatars

- **CEO Avatars:** After onboarding, you're matched with a famous CEO avatar (e.g., Elon Musk, Satya Nadella) based on your profile. Each avatar offers unique advice and inspiration tailored to your style.

## AI Sage

- **AI Sage:** An AI-powered mentor that provides personalized, actionable advice and answers your questions throughout your journey. The Sage references your CEO avatar and startup context for relevant guidance.

## Document Generation

- **AI Documents:** Instantly generate key startup documents (e.g., elevator pitch, lean canvas, investor deck) using AI, earning XP and achievements for each document created.

## Progress Dashboard

- **Dashboard:** Visualize your XP, level, quest completion rate, achievements, and more in a dedicated dashboard.

## Offline Support

- **Offline Mode:** The app supports offline persistence for core data, so you can continue your journey even without an internet connection (with some limitations).
