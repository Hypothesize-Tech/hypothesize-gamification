                                    Every founder has a Role with a corresponding Core Attribute (e.g., the Engineer's Core Attribute is Tech).
                                    Every quest on the roadmap is also tied to one of these attributes.

                                    When a founder completes a quest that matches their Role's Core Attribute, they trigger a Synergy Bonus,
                                    earning extra Experience Points (XP). This allows founders to level up faster by focusing on their strengths,
                                    while encouraging teams to delegate tasks to the most suitable member.
